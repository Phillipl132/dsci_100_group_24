Pulsars are rapidly spinning, uber-dense neutron stars. These neutrons are the collapsed cores of massive supergiant stars and emit rhythmic pulses of strong radiation due to their electromagnetism dipoles. While pulsars are rotating and emitting light at regular intervals, to the observers on earth, the pulsars are twinkling.  

For this project, we will be using the HTRU2 dataset and classifying the given candidates as pulsar or noise. The sample of pulsar candidates from the HTRU2 dataset was collected during the High Time Resolution Universe Survey, which “intends to be an all-sky survey for pulsars and short-duration radio transients, with a strong focus on the lower Galactic latitudes, [where the higher frequency resolution for the negation of interstellar dispersion are made used the most.]”

Binary classification systems are now being widely adopted for this matter, and will be used to represent whether the pulsar is real or not. In this data set, the legitimate pulsar examples are a minority positive class, and spurious examples are the majority negative class. 

The data set shared here contains 16,259 spurious examples caused by RFI/noise, and 1,639 real pulsar examples. These examples have all been checked by human annotators.

The data is presented in two formats: CSV and ARFF (used by the WEKA data mining tool). Candidates are stored in both files in separate rows. Each row lists the variables first, and the class label is the final entry. The class labels used are 0 (negative) and 1 (positive).
